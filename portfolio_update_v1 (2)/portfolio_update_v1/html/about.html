        <h2>My Past</h2>
        <p>I have mostly worked at various construction jobs throughout my life, everything from the foundation to the roof. I learned valuable lessons about patience and doing a quality job that I can apply to all area's of my life. I decided that construction is not where I want to spend my life so I started to look for something else. I realized that computers are the way to go. They consume so much of our lives, and so many people use them, that they will be around until we destroy ourselves.</p>

        <h2>My Future</h2>
        <p>I currently have a one year plan set for myself in which I plan to learn as much as I can and break into the Front End Development field. I believe this goal to be challenging but accomplishable. If I keep my eye on the prize and practice perseverence I am sure I will do just fine. </p>
